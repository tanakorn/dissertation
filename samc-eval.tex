\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec-eval}

We now evaluate SAMC by presenting experimental results that answer the
following questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How fast is SAMC in finding deep bugs compared to other state-of-the-art techniques?  
\item Can SAMC find new deep bugs?  
\item How much reduction ratio does SAMC provide?
\end{enumerate}

To answer the first question, we show SAMC's effectiveness in finding old
bugs.  For this, we have integrated \sampro\ to old versions of our target
systems that carry deep bugs: ZooKeeper v3.1.0, v3.3.2, v3.4.3, and v3.4.5,
Hadoop v2.0.3 and v2.2.0, and Cassandra v1.0.1 and v1.0.6.  To answer the
second question, we have integrated \sampro\ to two recent stable versions:
ZooKeeper v3.4.6 (released March 2014) and Hadoop v2.4.0 (released April
2014).  In total, we have integrated \sampro\ to \numVersions\ versions,
showing the high portability of our prototype.  Overall, our extensive
evaluation exercised more than 100,000 executions and used approximately 48
full machine days.
