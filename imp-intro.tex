\label{sec-impl}

\section{Overview}
In this chapter, we first describe our SAMC prototype, \sampro, which we
built from scratch because existing dmcks are either
proprietary~\cite{Yang+09-Modist} or only work on restricted high-level
languages (\eg, Mace~\cite{Killian+07-LifeDeathMaceMC}).  We will then describe
\sampro\ integration to three widely popular cloud systems,
ZooKeeper~\cite{Hunt+10-ZooKeeperPaper}, Hadoop/Yarn~\cite{Kumar+13-Yarn},
and Cassandra~\cite{Lakshman+09-Cassandra}.  Prior to \sampro, there was no
available dmck for these systems; they are still tested via unit tests, and
the test code size is bigger than the main code, but the tests are far from
reaching deep bugs.
