\subsection{Cloud Computing}

In the past decase, ``cloud computing'' has become widespread buzzword that IT
people often talk about. However, there is few agreement on what it really
means; many companies and experts have given many definitions
\cite{TwentyoneCloudDef, IBMCloudDef, PCMagCloudDef, Foster+08-CloudAndGrid}
that are different in details, but they share some common characteristics: cloud
computing is on-demand internet-based services that can scale to serve growing
users' requests, and users ``pay as they go''.

% probably write about 3 models of cloud SaaS, PaaS, IaaS

%benefit of cloud computing
Cloud computing can attract a number of users to move their data and
computation from local machines and private datacenters to the cloud
\cite{AdobeCloudStat, AWSCustomer, GmailStat, GoogleDriveStat, DropboxStat,
FacebookStat} \xxx{add more citation from scientific world}. It provides many
benefits as shown below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Users can access their computing resources and data any time and any
where. For example, Google Doc allows users to create/modify their documents on
one machine and access them later on mobile devices. This advantage also enables
new classes of applications, especially, mobile applications. \xxx{citation to
google doc, drive, dropbox, icloud, siri, voice recognition, gmail}

\item Users can cut the cost of hardware investment, but can get immedate access
to computing resources. Moreover, this will help improve hardware utilization.
Users do not need to pay while they are not using the resources
\cite{Marston+11-CloudBusiness} \xxx{citation about instagram, netflix, aws
customers}.

\item Most importantly, cloud computing help users to scale their services in a
convenient manner. When their workload is growing up, they can just purchase
more computing power from their cloud service providers.
\end{itemize}
