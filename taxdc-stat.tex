We now present other quantitative findings not included in
previous discussions.  We attempted to measure the complexity of DC
bugs using four metrics: (a) the number of ``re-enumerated steps'' as
informally defined in \sec\ref{met-valid}, (b) the patch LOC
including new test suites for the corresponding bug, (c) the time to
resolve (TTR), and (d) the number of discussion comments between the
bug submitter and developers.
%
The 25th percentile, median, and 75th percentile for the four metrics
are
%
(a) \stepTFP, \stepMed, and \stepSFP\ steps, 
%
(b) \locTFP, \locMed, and \locSFP\ LOC, 
%
(c) \ttrTFP, \ttrMed, and \ttrSFP\ days to resolve, 
%
(d) \commTFP, \commMed, and \commSFP\ comments.  

In terms of where the bugs were found, Figure \ref{bars}r (\BWHR)
highlights that \pctWhrField\ were found in deployment and
\pctWhrTest\ from failed unit tests.  The rest, \pctWhrNotDef, are not
defined (could be manually found or from deployment).  Some DC bugs
were reported from large-scale deployments such as executions of
thousands of tasks on hundreds of machines.%\spa
