\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chp-bg}

In this proposal, we aim to improve the dependability of the systems in two
aspects, reliability and scalability. Our work focus on unearthing bugs that are
related to these two issues. For reliability, we focus on {\em distributed
concurrency (DC) bugs}, and for scalability, we focus on {\em control-plane
scalability bugs}.

This chapter discusses the background of these two types of bugs and related
work to combat them.
