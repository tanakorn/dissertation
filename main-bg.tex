\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chp-bg}

This chapter provides the background of this dissertation. We briefly discuss
about cloud computing and cloud backend in Section \ref{bg-cloud}. We present
our initial work to understand bugs that occur in cloud-scale distributed
systems in Section \ref{bg-bugs}. Section \ref{bg-dc} and \ref{bg-sc} discuss DC
bugs and scalability bugs in detail respectively; we show how these bugs look
like and also give some overview of related work to combat them.

%We also discuss about related work to combat DC bugs and scalability bugs at
%the end of this chapter (Section \ref{bg-related}).
