\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chp-bg}

This chapter provides the background of this dissertation. We briefly discuss
about cloud computing and cloud-scale distributed systems in Section
\ref{bg-cloud}. Section \ref{bg-dc} and \ref{bg-sc} discuss about distributed
concurrency and scalability respectively. These are two aspects of distributed
systems that could threaten system dependability. And in those two sections
(Section \ref{bg-dc} and Section \ref{bg-sc}), we also briefly discuss how
system community address issues from distributed concurrency and scalability.
%
%We also discuss about related work to combat DC bugs and scalability bugs at
%the end of this chapter (Section \ref{bg-related}).
