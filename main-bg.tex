\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{chp-bg}

In this proposal, we focus on improving the dependability of the systems in two
aspects, reliability and scalability. We attempt to unearth bugs that cause
systems to perform unreliably regards to users' expectations (\eg\ users cannot
access services, or users' data are lost or corrupted). We also address bugs
that prevent systems to scale as users' demands grow (\ie\ systems cannot work
properly when we scale them out to support more requests). In this chapter, we
will discuss the background of these two types of bugs and related work to
combat them.
