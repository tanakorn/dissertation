\chapter{Summary}
\label{chp-con}

In this proposal, we aim to unearth hidden bugs in cloud-scale distributed
systems that weaken reliability and scalability of the systems. For reliability
bugs, we focus in distributed concurrency (DC) bugs. For scalability bugs, we
focus in control-plane protocol bug, specifically in P2P storage systems.

The key idea for unearthing DC bugs is advancing model checking techniques.
