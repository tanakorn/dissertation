\mycaption[\#DC bugs triggered by timing conditions]{tab:trig}{\#DC bugs triggered by timing conditions}
{The total is more than \numDcBugs\ because some bugs
require more than one triggering condition. More specifically, 46 bugs 
(\pctTrigOrder) are caused {\em only} by 
ordering violations, 21 bugs (\pctTrigAtom) 
{\em only} by atomicity violations, and 4 bugs (\pctTrigMix) by multiple timing 
conditions (as also shown in Figure \ref{bars}a).}
