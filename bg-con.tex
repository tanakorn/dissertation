\section{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we discuss about cloud-scale distributed systems, software
backend for the cloud computing. We show what the current trend of the systems
is and how they are design. We also discuss about distributed concurrency and
scalability, the two important aspects of cloud-scale distributed systems that
could threaten dependability of the systems. We briefly discuss how system
community address issues from the concurrency and scalability. Unfortunately,
distributed concurrency bugs are still an unsolved problem, and scalability bugs
are novel and not many works address about them.
