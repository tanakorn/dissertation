\section{\sck}

We now present the four \sck techniques to achieve high colocation factor in
one machine (Section \ref{sc-pil}-\ref{sc-mem}) and summarize how to use these
techniques to scale check the systems (Section \ref{sc-summ}).

The enabler of our methods is the fact that \sck is an offline check, which
provides us the liberty to re-architect distributed systems to be
scale-checkable offline, but without introducing performance overhead online.
%
When $N$ is large, every small optimization in \sck will lead to a multitude of
benefits.
%
When the four techniques are combined, \sck can achieve a colocation factor of
around 500 nodes with high result fidelity.
