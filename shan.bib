@InProceedings{EPFL-CONF-195651,
   abstract    = {Instruction-grain monitoring is a powerful approach that
                 enables a wide spectrum of bug-finding tools. As existing
                 software approaches incur prohibitive runtime overhead,
                 researchers have focused on hardware support for
                 instruction-grain monitoring. A recurring theme in recent
                 work is the use of hardware-assisted filtering so as to
                 elide costly software analysis. This work generalizes and
                 extends prior point solutions into a programmable
                 filtering accelerator affording vast flexibility and
                 at-speed event filtering. The pipelined microarchitecture
                 of the accelerator affords a peak filtering rate of one
                 application event per cycle, which suffices to keep up
                 with an aggressive OoO core running the monitored
                 application. A unique feature of the proposed design is
                 the ability to dynamically resolve dependencies between
                 unfilterable events and subsequent events, eliminating
                 data-dependent stalls and maximizing accelerator’s
                 performance. Our evaluation results show a monitoring
                 slowdown of just 1.2-1.8x across a diverse set of
                 monitoring tools.},

  booktitle="{Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Architectures for Networking and Communications Systems}",
  year={2011},
  abstract={
Algorithmic solutions to the packet classification problem in
network equipment have long been a subject of study in academia and
industry and with increases in network speeds they are becoming even
more important. Since general purpose processors cannot meet
performance and cost requirements, researchers have been assuming
that ASICs or FPGAs are necessary for hardware implementation.

Industry and academia have been working on SRAM-based platforms
specialized for tables used in network equipment, but existing
publications only describe the mapping of simpler exact match or
prefix match lookups to such platforms. In this paper we adopt a
software-hardware co-design approach mapping the EffiCuts algorithm to
the PLUG platform. Our work confirms that this solution achieves high
throughput (142 million packets per second) and low power (3.1 Watts).
It identifies and evaluates changes to the original algorithm and
to the platform that can improve throughput and memory utilization.

  abstract = {PARSEC is a reference application suite used in industry and academia
  to assess new chip multiprocessor (CMP) designs. No investigation
  to date has profiled PARSEC on real hardware to better understand
  scaling properties and bottlenecks. This understanding is crucial
  in guiding future CMP designs for these kinds of emerging workloads.
  We use hardware performance counters, taking a systems-level approach
  and varying common architectural parameters: number of out-of-order
  cores, memory hierarchy configurations, number of multiple simultaneous
  threads, number of memory channels, and processor frequencies. We
  find these programs to be largely compute-bound, and thus limited
  by number of cores, micro-architectural resources, and cache-to-cache
  transfers, rather than by off-chip memory or system bus bandwidth.
  Half the suite fails to scale linearly with increasing number of
  threads, and some applications saturate performance at few threads
  on all platforms tested. Exploiting thread level parallelism delivers
  greater payoffs than exploiting instruction level parallelism. To
  reduce power and improve performance, we recommend increasing the
  number of arithmetic units per core, increasing support for TLP,
  and reducing support for ILP.},

  error classification and proposes two new software-based comprehensive
  control-flow error detection techniques. The new techniques are better
  than the previous ones in the sense that they detect errors in all
  the branch-error categories. We implemented the techniques in our
  dynamic binary translator so that the techniques can be applied to
  existing x86 binaries transparently. We compared our new techniques
  with the previous ones and we show that our methods cover more errors

  abstract = {Chip multi-processors {(CMPs)} already have widespread commercial
  availability, and technology roadmaps project enough on-chip transistors
  to replicate tens or hundreds of current processor cores. How will
  we express parallelism, partition applications, and schedule/place/migrate
  threads on these highly-parallel {CMPs?This} paper presents and evaluates
  a new approach to highly-parallel {CMPs,} advocating a new hardware-software
  contract. The software layer is encouraged to expose large amounts
  of multi-granular, heterogeneous parallelism. The hardware, meanwhile,
  is designed to offer low-overhead, low-area support for orchestrating
  and modulating this parallelism on {CMPs} at runtime. Specifically,
  our proposed {CMP} architecture consists of architectural and {ISA}
  support targeting thread creation, scheduling and context-switching,
  designed to facilitate effective hardware run-time mapping of threads
  to cores at low {overheads.Dynamic} modulation of parallelism provides
  the ability to respond to run-time variability that arises from dataset
  changes, memory system effects and power spikes and lulls, to name
  a few. It also naturally provides a long-term {CMP} platform with
  performance portability and tolerance to frequency and reliability
  variations across multiple {CMP} generations. Our simulations of
  a range of applications possessing do-all, streaming and recursive
  parallellism show speedups of {4-11.5X} and energy-delay-product
  savings of {3.8X,} on average, on a 16-core vs. a 1-core system.
  This is achieved with modest amounts of hardware support that allows
  for low overheads in thread creation, scheduling and context-switching.
  In particular, our simulations motivated the need for hardware support,
  showing that the large thread management overheads of current run-time
  software systems can lead to up to {6.5X} slowdown. The difficulties
  faced in static scheduling were shown in our simulations with a static
  scheduling algorithm, fed with oracle profiled inputs suffering up
  to 107\% slowdown compared to {NDP's} hardware scheduler, due to
  its inability to handle memory system variabilities. More broadly,
  we feel that the ideas presented here show promise for scaling to
  the systems expected in ten years, where the advantages of high transistor
  counts may be dampened by difficulties in circuit variations and
  reliability. These issues will make dynamic scheduling and adaptation
  mandatory; our proposals represent a first step towards that direction.},

  abstract = {Active learning techniques, including collaborative programming and
  problem solving environments, have been widely adopted by many computer
  science educators. A related approach is the Treisman model, which
  was originally designed for the first-year calculus course and involves
  intensive workshops where students collaborate in small groups to
  solve problems. We have adapted the model for both the data structures
  and algorithms courses at our institution. Regression analysis indicates
  that students who participate in the workshops for the algorithms
  course perform better (0.561 grade points on a 4-point scale) than
  those who do not, even after accounting for prior academic performance.
  However, the workshops appear to have less of an effect on student
  grades in the data structures course. This study provides evidence
  that the workshop model can be an effective learning environment
  for students in courses primarily involving analysis, but that for
  courses that involve large amounts of programming, further adaptations
  to the model might be needed.},

  abstract = {Process variations are a manufacturing phenomenon that result in some
  parameters of the transistors in a real chip to be different from
  those specified in the design. One impact of these variations is
  that the affected circuits may perform faster or slower than the
  design target. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of chips speed
  up whereas the vast majority incur slow downs. While die-to-die variations
  have been addressed by clock binning, within-die variations are increasing
  in importance with scaling. Clock binning in the presence of within-die
  variations results in slow clock speeds for dies with many components
  that can operate at higher clock speeds. A recent paper addressing
  within-die variations proposes variable-latency functional units
  and register file so that the fast instances of these components
  take fewer clock cycles to operate than the slower instances. However,
  in pipeline stages where the instances are interdependent, the fast
  instances would be held up by the slow instances. Also, variable
  latency may complicate timing-critical instruction scheduling. Instead
  of varying the number of clock cycles, we advocate varying the clock
  speed. Our scheme, called Shapeshifter, maintains high clock speeds
  during {low-ILP} program phases by using a narrower pipeline of only
  the faster instances, and reduces the clock speed only in the {high-ILP}
  phases which use all the instances. Shapeshifter simply turns off
  the slow instances, removing them from any interdependence among
  all the instances. Also, Shapeshifter requires minimal additions
  to the pipeline because almost all pipelines already support varying
  the clock speed for power management purposes. Using simulations,
  we show that Shapeshifter performs better than clock binning and
  the variable-latency approach.},

  important pedagogies differentiated the pilot section from other
  sections: computer availability at all class meetings and the methodology

  section intended a computing major, but upon completion the students
  chose a computing major at a higher rate than the rates for other
  sections: 19\% versus 13\%. More striking is that 33\% of the pilot
  section women and 27\% of its minority students chose a computing
  major. All students completed the course and no student left the

  abstract = {This paper describes an efficient and robust approach to provide a
  safe execution environment for an entire operating system, such as
  Linux, and all its applications. The approach, which we call Secure
  Virtual Architecture {(SVA),} defines a virtual, low-level, typed
  instruction set suitable for executing all code on a system, including
  kernel and application code. {SVA} code is translated for execution
  by a virtual machine transparently, offline or online. {SVA} aims
  to enforce fine-grained (object level) memory safety, control-flow
  integrity, type safety for a subset of objects, and sound analysis.
  A virtual machine implementing {SVA} achieves these goals by using
  a novel approach that exploits properties of existing memory pools
  in the kernel and by preserving the kernel's explicit control over
  memory, including custom allocators and explicit deallocation. Furthermore,
  the safety properties can be encoded compactly as extensions to the
  {SVA} type system, allowing the (complex) safety checking compiler
  to be outside the trusted computing base. {SVA} also defines a set
  of {OS} interface operations that abstract all privileged hardware
  instructions, allowing the virtual machine to monitor all privileged
  operations and control the physical resources on a given hardware
  platform. We have ported the Linux kernel to {SVA,} treating it as
  a new architecture, and made only minimal code changes (less than
  300 lines of code) to the machine-independent parts of the kernel
  and device drivers. {SVA} is able to prevent 4 out of 5 memory safety
  exploits previously reported for the Linux 2.4.22 kernel for which
  exploit code is available, and would prevent the fifth one simply
  by compiling an additional kernel library.},

  a fine-grain partitioning of memory called Automatic Pool Allocation.
  Together, these techniques bring the average overhead checks down

  show that the memory partitioning is key to bringing down this overhead.

  Processor architects today are faced by two daunting challenges: emerging
  applications with heterogeneous computation needs and technology
  limitations of power, wire delay, and process variation. Designing
  multiple application-specific processors or specialized architectures
  introduces design complexity, a software programmability problem,
  and reduces economies of scale. There is a pressing need for design
  methodologies that can provide support for heterogeneous applications,
  combat processor complexity, and achieve economies of scale. In this
  dissertation, we introduce the notion of architectural polymorphism
  to build such scalable processors that provide support for heterogeneous
  computation by supporting different granularities of parallelism.
  Polymorphism configures coarse-grained microarchitecture blocks to
  provide an adaptive and flexible processor substrate. Technology
  scalability is achieved by designing an architecture using scalable
  and modular microarchitecture blocks.
  
  We use the dataflow graph as the unifying abstraction layer across
  three granularities of parallelism--instruction-level, thread-level,
  and data-level. To first order, this granularity of parallelism is
  the main difference between different classes of applications. All
  programs are expressed in terms of dataflow graphs and directly mapped
  to the hardware, appropriately partitioned as required by the granularity
  of parallelism. We introduce Explicit Data Graph Execution (EDGE)
  ISAs, a class of ISAs as an architectural solution for efficiently
  expressing parallelism for building technology scalable architectures.
  
  We developed the TRIPS architecture implementating an EDGE ISA using
  a heavily partitioned and distributed microarchitecture to achieve
  technology scalability. The two most significant features of the
  TRIPS microarchitecture are its heavily partitioned and modular design,
  and the use of microarchitecture networks for communication across
  modules. We have also built a prototype TRIPS chip in 130nm ASIC
  technology composed of two processor cores and a distributed 1MB
  Non-Uniform Cache Access Architecture (NUCA) on-chip memory system.
  
  Our performance results show that the TRIPS microarchitecture which
  provides a 16-issue machine with a 1024-entry instruction window
  can sustain good instruction-level parallelism. On a set of hand-optimized
  kernels IPCs in the range of 4 to 6 are seen, and on a set of benchmarks
  with ample data-level parallelism (DLP), compiler generated code
  produces IPCs in the range of 1 to 4. On the EEMBC and SPEC CPU2000
  benchmarks we see IPCs in the range of 0.5 to 2.3. Comparing performance
  to the Alpha 21264, which is a high performance architecture tuned
  for ILP, TRIPS is up to 3.4 times better on the hand optimized kernels.
  However, compiler generated binaries for the DLP, EEMBC, and SPEC
  CPU2000 benchmarks perform worse on TRIPS compared to an Alpha 21264.
  With more aggressive compiler optimization we expect the performance
  of the compiler produced binaries to improve.
  
  The polymorphous mechanisms proposed in this dissertation are effective
  at exploiting thread-level parallelism and data-level parallelism.
  When executing four threads on a single processor, significantly
  high levels of processor utilization are seen; IPCs are in the range
  of 0.7 to 3.9 for an application mix consisting of EEMBC and SPEC
  CPU2000 workloads. When executing programs with DLP, the polymorphous
  mechanisms we propose provide harmonic mean speedups of 2.1X across
  a set of DLP workloads, compared to an execution model of extracting
  only ILP. Compared to specialized architectures, these mechanisms
  provide competitive performance using a single execution substrate.},

  abstract = {Due to fundamental device properties, energy efficiency from CMOS
  scaling is showing diminishing improvements. To overcome the energy
  efficiency challenges, timing speculation has been proposed to optimize
  for common-case timing conditions, with errors occurring under worst-case
  conditions detected and corrected in hardware. Although various timing
  speculation techniques have been proposed, no general framework exists
  for reasoning about the trade-offs and high-level design considerations
  of timing speculation. This paper develops two models to study the
  end-to-end behavior of timing speculation: a hardware-level efficiency
  model that considers the effects of process variations on path delays,
  and a complementary system-level recovery model. When combined, the
  models are used to assess the impact of technology scaling, CMOS
  design style, and fault recovery mechanism on the efficiency of timing
  speculation. Our results show that (1) efficiency gains from timing
  speculation do not improve as technology scales, (2) ultralow power
  (sub-threshold) CMOS designs benefit most from timing speculation
  � we report a 47\% potential energydelay reduction, and (3) fine-grained
  fault recovery is key to significant energy improvements. The combined
  model uses only high-level inputs to derive quantitative energy efficiency
  benefits without any need for detailed simulation, making it a potentially
  useful tool for hardware developers.},

  abstract = {By compiling ordinary scientific applications programs with a radical
  technique called trace scheduling, we are generating code for a parallel
  machine that will run these programs faster than an equivalent sequential
  machine—we expect 10 to 30 times faster. Trace scheduling generates
  code for machines called Very Long Instruction Word architectures.
  In Very Long Instruction Word machines, many statically scheduled,
  tightly coupled, fine-grained operations execute in parallel within
  a single instruction stream. {VLIWs} are more parallel extensions
  of several current architectures. These current architectures have
  never cracked a fundamental barrier. The speedup they get from parallelism
  is never more than a factor of 2 to 3. Not that we couldn't build
  more parallel machines of this type; but until trace scheduling we
  didn't know how to generate code for them. Trace scheduling finds
  sufficient parallelism in ordinary code to justify thinking about
  a highly parallel {VLIW.} At Yale we are actually building one. Our
  machine, the {ELI-512,} has a horizontal instruction word of over
  500 bits and will do 10 to 30 {RISC-level} operations per cycle {[Patterson}
  82]. {ELI} stands for Enormously Longword Instructions; 512 is the
  size of the instruction word we hope to achieve. {(The} current design
  has a 1200-bit instruction word.) Once it became clear that we could
  actually compile code for a {VLIW} machine, some new questions appeared,
  and answers are presented in this paper. How do we put enough tests
  in each cycle without making the machine too big? How do we put enough
  memory references in each cycle without making the machine too slow?},

  tasks such as ray-triangle intersection, making them attractive target
  platforms for raytracing. To date, most {GPU-based} raytracers have
  relied upon uniform grid acceleration structures. In contrast, the
  kd-tree has gained widespread use in {CPU-based} raytracers and is
  regarded as the best general-purpose acceleration structure. We demonstrate
  two kd-tree traversal algorithms suitable for {GPU} implementation
  and integrate them into a streaming raytracer. We show that for scenes
  with many objects at different scales, our kd-tree algorithms are
  up to 8 times faster than a uniform grid. In addition, we identify
  load balancing and input data recirculation as two fundamental sources
  of inefficiency when raytracing on current graphics hardware.},

  abstract = {To address the increasing susceptibility of commodity chip multiprocessors
  {(CMPs)} to transient faults, we propose Chip-level Redundantly Threaded
  multiprocessor with Recovery {(CRTR).} {CRTR} extends the previously-proposed
  {CRT} for transient-fault detection in {CMPs,} and the previously-proposed
  {SRTR} for transient-fault recovery in {SMT.} All these schemes achieve
  fault tolerance by executing and comparing two copies, called leading
  and trailing threads, of a given application. Previous recovery schemes
  for {SMT} do not perform well on {CMPs.} In a {CMP,} the leading
  and trailing threads execute on different processors to achieve load
  balancing and reduce the probability of a fault corrupting both threads;
  whereas in an {SMT,} both threads execute on the same processor.
  The interprocessor communication required to compare the threads
  introduces latency and bandwidth problems not present in an {SMT.}
  To hide interprocessor latency, {CRTR} executes the leading thread
  ahead of the trailing thread by maintaining a long slack, enabled
  by asymmetric commit. {CRTR} commits the leading thread before checking
  and the trailing thread after checking, so that the trailing thread
  state may be used for recovery. Previous recovery schemes commit
  both threads after checking, making a long slack suboptimal. To tackle
  interprocessor bandwidth, {CRTR} not only increases the bandwidth
  supply by pipelining the communication paths, but also reduces the
  bandwidth demand. By reasoning that faults propagate through dependences,
  previously-proposed dependence based checking elision {(DBCE)} exploits
  (true) register dependence chains so that only the value of the last
  instruction in a chain is checked. However, instructions that mask
  operand bits may mask faults and limit the use of dependence chains.
  We propose death-and dependence-based checking elision {(DDBCE),}
  which chains a masking instruction only if the source operand of
  the instruction dies after the instruction. Register deaths ensure
  that masked faults do not corrupt later computation. Using {SPEC2000,}
  we show that {CRTR} incurs negligible performance loss compared to
  {CRT} for interprocessor (one-way) latency as high as 30 cycles,
  and that the bandwidth requirements of {CRT} and {CRTR} with {DDBCE}
  are 5.2 and 7.1 bytes/cycle, respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces {DIDUCE,} a practical and effective tool that
  aids programmers in detecting complex program errors and identifying
  their root causes. By instrumenting a program and observing its behavior
  as it runs, {DIDUCE} dynamically formulates hypotheses of invariants
  obeyed by the program. {DIDUCE} hypothesizes the strictest invariants
  at the beginning, and gradually relaxes the hypothesis as violations
  are detected to allow for new behavior. The violations reported help
  users to catch software bugs as soon as they occur. They also give
  programmers new visibility into the behavior of the programs such
  as identifying rare corner cases in the program logic or even locating
  hidden errors that corrupt the program's {results.We} implemented
  the {DIDUCE} system for Java programs and applied it to four programs
  of significant size and complexity. {DIDUCE} succeeded in identifying
  the root causes of programming errors in each of the programs quickly
  and automatically. In particular, {DIDUCE} is effective in isolating
  a timing-dependent bug in a released {JSSE} {(Java} Secure Socket
  Extension) library, which would have taken an experienced programmer
  days to find. Our experience suggests that detecting and checking
  program invariants dynamically is a simple and effective methodology

  abstract = {Microprocessor design is undergoing a major paradigm shift towards
  multi-core designs, in anticipation that future performance gains
  will come from exploiting threadlevel parallelism in the software.
  To support this trend, we present a novel processor architecture
  called the Multiple Instruction Stream Processing {(MISP)} architecture.
  {MISP} introduces the sequencer as a new category of architectural
  resource, and defines a canonical set of instructions to support
  user-level inter-sequencer signaling and asynchronous control transfer.
  {MISP} allows an application program to directly manage user-level
  threads without {OS} intervention. By supporting the classic cache-coherent
  shared-memory programming model, {MISP} does not require a radical
  shift in the multithreaded programming paradigm. This paper describes
  the design and evaluation of the {MISP} architecture for the {IA-32}
  family of microprocessors. Using a research prototype {MISP} processor
  built on an {IA-32-based} multiprocessor system equipped with special
  firmware, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the {MISP}
  architecture. We then examine the utility of {MISP} by (1) assessing
  the key architectural tradeoffs of the {MISP} architecture design
  and (2) showing how legacy multithreaded applications can be migrated
  to {MISP} with relative ease.},

  A theory is presented fora wide range of power/performance metrics,

  the shorter the optimum pipeline length thatresults. For typical
  parameters neither {BIPS/W} {norBIPS2/W} yield an optimum, i.e.,

  a 7stage pipeline, but this value is highly dependent on theassumed
  growth in latch count with pipeline depth. Asdynamic power grows,

  pushes the optimum todeeper pipelines. Surprisingly, as leakage power
  grows,the optimum is also found to shift to deeper pipelines. Theoptimum

  Although the x86 {ISA} is targeted, the overall approach is applicable

  executed code sequences, fully transparent dynamic translation software
  decomposes {CISC} superblocks into {RISC-style} micro-ops. Then,
  pairs of dependent micro-ops are reordered and fused into macro-ops
  held in a large, concealed code cache. The macro-ops are fetched
  from the code cache and processed throughout the pipeline as single
  units. Consequently, instruction level communication and management
  are reduced, and processor resources such as the issue buffer and
  register file ports are better utilized. Moreover, fused instructions
  lead naturally to pipelined instruction scheduling (issue) logic,
  and collapsed 3-1 {ALUs} can be used, resulting in much simplified
  result forwarding logic. Steady state performance is evaluated for
  the {SPEC2000} benchmarks, and a proposed x86 implementation with
  complexity similar to a two-wide superscalar processor is shown to
  provide performance (instructions per cycle) that is equivalent to
  a conventional four-wide superscalar processor.},

  if pairs of dependent instructions are fused so they share a single
  instruction scheduling slot. We study an implementation of the x86
  {ISA} that dynamically translates x86 code to an underlying {ISA}
  that supports instruction fusing. A microarchitecture that is codesigned
  with the fused instruction set completes the implementation. We focus
  on the dynamic binary translator for such a codesigned x86 virtual
  machine. The dynamic binary translator first cracks x86 instructions
  belonging to hot superblocks into {RISC-style} microoperations, and
  then uses heuristics to fuse together pairs of dependent microoperations.
  Experimental results with {SPEC2000} integer benchmarks demonstrate
  that: (1) the fused {ISA} with dynamic binary translation reduces
  the number of scheduling decisions by about 30\% versus a conventional

  abstract = {MapReduce is a simple and flexible parallel programming model proposed
  by Google for large-scale distributed data processing. In this paper,
  we present a design and prototype implementation of MapReduce for
  the Cell Broadband Engine� Architecture (CBEA). The MapReduce model
  provides a simple machine abstraction that shields users from parallelization
  and other distributed programming complications. The goal of this
  paper is to describe the tradeoffs in the design of the runtime and
  demonstrate the potential for high performance. We study the basic
  characteristics of the MapReduce model and identify three types of
  MapReduce applications: map dominated, partition dominated, and sort
  dominated. We evaluate our runtime performance, scalability, and
  efficiency for microbenchmarks representing each of these application
  types as well as for complete applications. We find that map-dominated
  applications map well to the CBEA and that our prototype sustains
  high performance on these applications. For partition-dominated and
  sort-dominated applications, we analyze runtime performance, identify
  sources of inefficiency, and propose several future enhancements
  to significantly improve performance. Overall, we find that the simplicity
  and efficiency of the model make it an attractive tool for programming
  Cell Broadband Engine processor-based platforms. },

  As technology scales ever further, device unreliability is creating
  excessive complexity for hardware to maintain the illusion of perfect
  operation. In this paper, we consider whether exposing hardware fault
  information to software and allowing software to control fault recovery
  simplifies hardware design and helps technology scaling.
  
  The combination of emerging applications and emerging many-core architectures
  makes software recovery a viable alternative to hardware-based fault
  recovery. Emerging applications tend to have few I/O and memory side-effects,
  which limits the amount of information that needs checkpointing,
  and they allow discarding individual sub-computations with small
  qualitative impact. Software recovery can harness these properties
  in ways that hardware recovery cannot.
  
  We describe Relax, an architectural framework for software recovery
  of hardware faults. Relax includes three core components: (1) an
  ISA extension that allows software to mark regions of code for software
  recovery, (2) a hardware organization that simplifies reliability
  considerations and provdes) an ISA extension that allows software
  to mark regions of code for software energy efficiency with hardware
  recovery support removed, and (3) software support for compilers
  and programmers to utilize the Relax ISA. Applying Relax to counter
  the effects of process variation, our results show a 20\% energy
  efficiency improvement for PARSEC applications with only minimal
  source code changes and simpler hardware.},

  abstract = {Modern network devices employ deep packet inspection to enable sophisticated
  services such as intrusion detection, traffic shaping, and load balancing.
  At the heart of such services is a signature matching engine that
  must match packet payloads to multiple signatures at line rates.
  However, the recent transition to complex regular-expression based
  signatures coupled with ever-increasing network speeds has rapidly
  increased the performance requirements of signature matching. Solutions
  to meet these requirements range from hardware-centric ASIC/FPGA
  implementations to software implementations using high-performance
  microprocessors.
  
  
  In this paper, we propose a programmable signature matching system
  prototyped on an Nvidia G80 GPU. We first present a detailed architectural
  and microarchitectural analysis, showing that signature matching
  is well suited for SIMD processing because of regular control flow
  and parallelism available at the packet level. Next, we examine two
  approaches for matching signatures: standard deterministic finite
  automata (DFAs) and extended finite automata (XFAs), which use far
  less memory than DFAs but require specialized auxiliary memory and
  small amounts of computation in most states. We implement a fully
  functional prototype on the SIMD-based G80 GPU. This system out-performs
  a Pentium4 by up to 9X and a Niagara-based 32-threaded system by
  up to 2.3X and shows that GPUs are a promising candidate for signature
  matching. },

  Replay builds a timing-error predictor based on timing speculations�s
  aggressive clock period. We use a heuristic which replicates the
  combination logic and uses path delays to determine which paths will
  be excited based on the aggressive clock period. The timing-error
  prediction accuracy is more than 99% for a set of real workloads
  on the OpenRISC processor and the FPGA emulation speed shows practically
  no slowdown. We also demonstrate that Replay can evaluate the impact
  of voltage-drop timing-faults. This fast and accurate timing-error
  prediction enables practical emulation of timing-speculation and
  quantitative analysis early in the design-cycle.},

  use both sensitivity and PVP to measure the efficacy of sharing prediction
  schemes and study tradeoffs. High PVP schemes have low sensitivity
  and miss many opportunities for sharing but generate low extra traffic.
  High sensitivity schemes win more often in absolute terms but also
  generate more traffic. Thus there is a badnwidth-latency tradefoff:

  abstract = {SPEC CPU benchmarks are commonly used by compiler writers and architects
  of general purpose processors for performance evaluation. Since the
  release of the CPU89 suite, the SPEC CPU benchmark suites have evolved,
  with applications either removed or added or upgraded. This influences
  the design decisions for the next generation compilers and microarchitectures.
  In view of the above, it is critical to characterize the applications
  in the new suite - SPEC CPU2006 - to guide the decision making process.
  Although similar studies using the retired SPEC CPU benchmark suites
  have been done in the past, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough
  performance characterization of CPU2006 and its comparison with CPU2000
  has not been done so far. In this paper, we present the above. For
  this, we compiled the applications in CPU2000 and CPU2006 using the
  Intelreg2 Fortran/C++ optimizing compiler and executed them, using
  the reference data sets, on the state-of-the-art Intel Coretrade2
  Duo processor. The performance information was collected by using
  the Intel VTunetrade performance analyzer that takes advantage of
  the built-in hardware performance counters to obtain accurate information
  on program behavior and its use of processor resources. The focus
  of this paper is on branch and memory access behavior, the well-known
  reasons for program performance problems. By analyzing and comparing
  the L1 data and L2 cache miss rates, branch prediction accuracy,
  and resource stalls the performance impact in each suite is indirectly
  determined and described. Not surprisingly, the CPU2006 codes are
  larger, more complex, and have larger data sets. This leads to higher
  average L2 cache miss rates and a slight reduction in average IPC
  compared to the CPU2000 suite. Similarly, the average branch behavior
  is slightly worse in CPU2006 suite. However, based on processor stall
  counts branches are much less of a problem. The results presented
  here are a step towards understanding the SPEC CPU2- - 006 benchmarks
  and will aid compiler writers in understanding the impact of currently
  implemented optimizations and in the design of new ones to address
  the new challenges presented by SPEC CPU2006. Similar opportunities
  exist for architecture optimization.},

  applications by performing speculative read requests alone. MSPS
  use two techniques to trigger speculation. Speculative Write Invalidation
  (SWI) heuristic predicts when a producer is done writing, invalidates
  the copy speculatively, and forwards the block to the consumers.
  The second technique uses read requests from first consumer to forward
  copies to the other consumers. The read request technique results
  in 8\% average and 17\% max reduction in execution time. The SWI
  approach reduces execution time on average by 12\% and at best 24\%.},

  abstract = {This paper describes Automatic Pool Allocation, a transformation framework
  that segregates distinct instances of heap-based data structures
  into seperate memory pools and allows heuristics to be used to partially
  control the internal layout of those data structures. The primary
  goal of this work is performance improvement, not automatic memory
  management, and the paper makes several new contributions. The key
  contribution is a new compiler algorithm for partitioning heap objects
  in imperative programs based on a context-sensitive pointer analysis,
  including a novel strategy for correct handling of indirect (and
  potentially unsafe) function calls. The transformation does not require
  type safe programs and works for the full generality of C and C++.
  Second, the paper describes several optimizations that exploit data
  structure partitioning to further improve program performance. Third,
  the paper evaluates how memory hierarchy behavior and overall program
  performance are impacted by the new transformations. Using a number
  of benchmarks and a few applications, we find that compilation times
  are extremely low, and overall running times for heap intensive programs
  speed up by 10-25\% in many cases, about 2x in two cases, and more
  than 10x in two small benchmarks. Overall, we believe this work provides
  a new framework for optimizing pointer intensive programs by segregating
  and controlling the layout of heap-based data structures.},

  theoretically and in practice) for storing large amounts of information,
  especially on secondary storage devices. We examine the problem of
  overcoming the inherent difficulty of concurrent operations on such
  structures, using a practical storage model. A single additional
  “link” pointer in each node allows a process to easily recover from
  tree modifications performed by other concurrent processes. Our solution
  compares favorably with earlier solutions in that the locking scheme
  is simpler (no read-locks are used) and only a (small) constant number
  of nodes are locked by any update process at any given time. An informal
  correctness proof for our system is given.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have found that gender gaps in information and communication technology {(ICT)} skills exist, despite changing gender role expectations for men and women. In this paper we report on survey results from an ongoing longitudinal study of {ICT} skills which found that--in general-- first-year students were confident in their {ICT} skills. However, comparison of student skills in four major technology domain areas indicates that there are differences between the male and fale first-year students in levels of confidence. We also report on a second, follow-up study designed to examine the actual {ICT} skills of the first-year students. This investigation indicates that both male and fale students have greater confidence than actual skill. The study also found that both male and fale students have approximately the same level of actual {ICT} skills. These findings suggest that fale students, although possessing {ICT} skills similar to their male counterparts, do not perceive thselves as competent users of technology. These differences in {ICT} skill confidence have implications for fluency with technology in acadia as well as the recruitment and retention of women in the Computer and Information Sciences.},

  to converting the linear instruction stream into a representation
  that allows the execution of instructions in data dependence order,
  rather than program order, to extract instruction level parallelism.
  All errors caused by hardware faults in this circuitry-- which includes
  the fetch and decode stages, renaming and scheduling logic, as well
  as the commit stage--will manifest themselves as incorrectly constructed
  dataflow graphs. Dynamic Dataflow Verification {(DDFV)} compares
  the dynamically constructed and executed dataflow graph to the expected
  dataflow graph of the static program binary, represented by a signature
  embedded in the instruction stream. The signature comparison enables
  comprehensive detection of transient errors, permanent errors, and
  design bugs in the dataflow circuitry. We show that {DDFV} detects
  errors with high probability, at a low hardware and performance cost.},

  Transactional Memory (TM) systems must track the read and write sets---items
  read and written during a transaction---to detect conflicts among
  concurrent transactions. Several TMs use signatures, which summarize
  unbounded read/write sets in bounded hardware at a performance cost
  of false positives (conflicts detected when none exists).
  
  This paper examines different organizations to achieve hardware-efficient
  and accurate TM signatures. First, we find that implementing each
  signature with a single $k$-hash-function Bloom filter (True Bloom
  signature) is inefficient, as it requires multi-ported SRAMs. Instead,
  we advocate using $k$ single-hash-function Bloom filters in parallel
  (Parallel Bloom signature), using area-efficient single-ported SRAMs.
  Our formal analysis shows that both organizations perform equally
  well in theory and our simulation-based evaluation shows this to
  hold approximately in practice. We also show that by choosing high-quality
  hash functions we can achieve signature designs noticeably more accurate
  than the previously proposed implementations. Finally, we adapt Pagh
  and Rodler's cuckoo hashing to implement Cuckoo-Bloom signatures.
  While this representation does not support set intersection, it mitigates
  false positives for the common case of small read/write sets and
  performs like a Bloom filter for large sets.},

  abstract = {Spatial Computing (SC) has been shown to be an energy-efficient model
  for implementing program kernels. In this paper we explore the feasibility
  of using SC for more than small kernels. To this end, we evaluate
  the performance and energy efficiency of entire applications on Tartan,
  a general-purpose architecture which integrates a reconfigurable
  fabric (RF) with a superscalar core. Our compiler automatically partitions
  and compiles an application into an instruction stream for the core
  and a configuration for the RF. We use a detailed simulator to capture
  both timing and energy numbers for all parts of the system.Our results
  indicate that a hierarchical RF architecture, designed around a scalable
  interconnect, is instrumental in harnessing the benefits of spatial
  computation. The interconnect uses static configuration and routing
  at the lower levels and a packet-switched, dynamically-routed network
  at the top level. Tartan is most energyefficient when almost all
  of the application is mapped to the RF, indicating the need for the
  RF to support most general-purpose programming constructs. Our initial
  investigation reveals that such a system can provide, on average,
  an order of magnitude improvement in energy-delay compared to an
  aggressive superscalar core on single-threaded workloads.},

  abstract = {Microarchitecturally integrated on-chip networks, or micronets, are
  candidates to replace busses for processor component interconnect
  in future processor designs. For micronets, tight coupling between
  processor microarchitecture and network architecture is one of the
  keys to improving processor performance. This paper presents the
  design, implementation and evaluation of the TRIPS operand network
  (OPN). The TRIPS OPN is a 5times5, dynamically routed, 2D mesh micronet
  that is integrated into the TRIPS microprocessor core. The TRIPS
  OPN is used for operand passing, register file I/O, and primary memory
  system I/O. We discuss in detail the OPN design, including the unique
  features that arise from its integration with the processor core,
  such as its connection to the execution unit's wakeup pipeline and
  its in flight mis-speculated traffic removal. We then evaluate the
  performance of the network under synthetic and realistic loads. Finally,
  we assess the processor performance implications of OPN design decisions
  with respect to the end-to-end latency of OPN packets and the OPN's
  bandwidth.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new architecture called Pipelined LookUp Grid
  (PLUG) that can perform data structure lookups in network processing.
  PLUGs are programmable and through simplicity achieve power efficiency.
  We draw upon the insights that data structure lookups have natural
  structure that can be statically determined and exploited. The PLUG
  execution model transforms data-structure lookups into pipelined
  stages of computation and associates small code-blocks with data.
  The PLUG architecture is a tiled architecture with each tile consisting
  predominantly of SRAMs, a lightweight no-buffering router, and an
  array of lightweight computation cores. Using a principle of fixed
  delays in the execution model, the architecture is contention-free
  and completely statically scheduled thus achieving high energy efficiency.
  The architecture enables rapid deployment of new network protocols
  and generalizes as a data-structure accelerator.
  
  This paper describes the PLUG architecture, the compiler, and evaluates
  our RTL prototype PLUG chip synthesized on a 55nm technology library.
  We evaluate six diverse high-end network processing workloads including
  IPv4, IPv6, and Ethernet forwarding. We show that at a 55nm technology,
  a 16-tile PLUG occupies 58 mm2, provides 4MB on-chip storage, and
  sustains a clock frequency of 1 GHz. This translates to 1 billion
  lookups per second, a latency of 18ns to 219ns, and average power
  less than 1 watt.},

  computation and molecular probes to form nanoscale sensor processors
  {(nSP).} We show how {nSPs} may enable new computing domains and
  automate tasks that currently require expert scientific training
  and costly equipment. This new application domain severely constrains
  {nSP} size, which significantly impacts the architectural design
  space. In this context, we explore {nSP} architectures and present
  an {nSP} design that includes a simple accumulator-based {ISA,} sensors,
  limited memory and communication transceivers. To reduce the application
  memory footprint, we introduce the concept of instruction-fused sensing.
  We use simulation and analytical models to evaluate {nSP} designs
  executing a representative set of target applications. Furthermore,
  we propose a candidate {nSP} technology based on optical Resonance
  Energy Transfer {(RET)} logic that enables the small size required
  by the application domain; our smallest design is about the size
  of the largest known virus. We also show laboratory results that
  demonstrate initial steps towards a prototype.},

  abstract = {Fault screeners are a new breed of fault identification technique
  that can probabilistically detect if a transient fault has affected
  the state of a processor. We demonstrate that fault screeners function
  because of two key characteristics. First, we show that much of the
  intermediate data generated by a program inherently falls within
  certain consistent bounds. Second, we observe that these bounds are
  often violated by the introduction of a fault. Thus, fault screeners
  can identify faults by directly watching for any data inconsistencies
  arising in an application's behavior. We present an idealized algorithm
  capable of identifying over 85\% of injected faults on the {SpecInt}
  suite and over 75\% overall. Further, in a realistic implementation
  on a simulated {Pentium-III-like} processor, about half of the errors
  due to injected faults are identified while still in speculative
  state. Errors detected this early can be eliminated by a pipeline
  flush. In this paper, we present several hardware-based versions
  of this screening algorithm and show that flushing the pipeline every
  time the hardware screener triggers reduces overall performance by
  less than 1\%},

  abstract = {As chip densities and clock rates increase, processors are becoming
  more susceptible to transient faults that can affect program correctness.
  Up to now, system designers have primarily considered hardware-only
  and software-only fault-detection mechanisms to identify and mitigate
  the deleterious effects of transient faults. These two fault-detection
  systems, however, are extremes in the design space, representing
  sharp trade-offs between hardware cost, reliability, and performance.
  In this paper, we identify hybrid hardware/software fault-detection
  mechanisms as promising alternatives to hardware-only and software-only
  systems. These hybrid systems offer designers more options to fit
  their reliability needs within their hardware and performance budgets.
  We propose and evaluate {CRAFT,} a suite of three such hybrid techniques,
  to illustrate the potential of the hybrid approach. For fair, quantitative
  comparisons among hardware, software, and hybrid systems, we introduce
  a new metric, mean work to failure, which is able to compare systems
  for which machine instructions do not represent a constant unit of
  work. Additionally, we present a new simulation framework which rapidly
  assesses reliability and does not depend on manual identification
  of failure modes. Our evaluation illustrates that {CRAFT,} and hybrid
  techniques in general, offer attractive options in the fault-detection
  design space.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique for enabling computations to survive errors
  and faults while providing a bound on any resulting output distortion.
  A developer using the technique first partitions the computation
  into tasks. The execution platform then simply discards any task
  that encounters an error or a fault and completes the computation
  by executing any remaining tasks. This technique can substantially
  improve the robustness of the computation in the face of errors and
  faults. A potential concern is that discarding tasks may change the
  result that the computation {produces.Our} technique randomly samples
  executions of the program at varying task failure rates to obtain
  a quantitative, probabilistic model that characterizes the distortion
  of the output as a function of the task failure rates. By providing
  probabilistic bounds on the distortion, the model allows users to
  confidently accept results produced by executions with failures as
  long as the distortion falls within acceptable bounds. This approach
  may prove to be especially useful for enabling computations to successfully
  survive hardware failures in distributed computing {environments.Our}
  technique also produces a timing model that characterizes the execution
  time as a function of the task failure rates. The combination of
  the distortion and timing models quantifies an accuracy/execution
  time tradeoff. It therefore enables the development of techniques
  that purposefully fail tasks to reduce the execution time while keeping
  the distortion within acceptable bounds.},

  processor. The synthesized design is simulated, and transients are
  injected to stress the processor while it is executing selected applications.
  Analysis of the collected data shows that fault sensitivity of the
  combinational logic (4.2\% for a fault duration of one clock cycle)
  is not negligible, even though it is smaller than the fault sensitivity
  of flip-flops (10.4\%). Detailed study of the error impact, measured
  at the application level, reveals that errors in speculation and
  control blocks collectively contribute to about 34\% of crashes,
  34\% of fail-silent violations and 69\% of application incomplete
  executions. These figures indicate the increasing need for processor-level
  detection techniques over generic methods, such as {ECC} and parity,

  abstract = {Engaging students in the learning process has been shown to be an
  effective means for education. Several methods have been proposed
  to achieve this engagement for computer science and other disciplines.
  Active learning is one such technique that incorporates interactive
  classroom activities to reinforce concepts and involve the students.
  Visualizations of computer science concepts such as algorithm animations
  can be used for these activities. To be most effective in this environment,
  they need to be designed and used with active learning in mind. This
  paper describes the design characteristics of such visualizations,
  ways of using them in the classroom, and our experience with developing
  and using visualization tools across different courses in the computer
  science curriculum.},

  via a combination of hardware and software. Dynamic binary translation
  converts code written for a conventional (legacy) {ISA} into optimized
  code for an underlying implementation-specific {ISA.} Because translation
  is done dynamically, an important consideration in such systems is
  the startup time for performing the initial translations. Beginning
  with a previously proposed co-designed {VM} that implements the x86
  {ISA,} we study runtime binary translation overhead effects. The
  co-designed x86 virtual machine is based on an adaptive translation
  system that uses a basic block translator for initial emulation and
  a superblock translator for hotspot optimization. We analyze and
  model {VM} startup performance via simulation. We observe that non-hotspot
  emulation via basic block translation is the major part of the startup
  overhead. To reduce startup translation overhead, we follow the co-designed
  hardware/software philosophy and propose hardware assists to dramatically
  accelerate basic block translations. By combining hardware assists
  with balanced translation strategies, the co-designed translation
  system reduces runtime overhead significantly and demonstrates very
  competitive startup performance when compared with conventional processors
  running a set of Windows application benchmarks},

  abstract = {New protocols for the data link and network layer are being proposed
  to address limitations of current protocols in terms of scalability,
  security, and manageability. High-speed routers and switches that
  implement these protocols traditionally perform packet processing
  using ASICs which offer high speed, low chip area, and low power.
  But with inflexible custom hardware, the deployment of new protocols
  could happen only through equipment upgrades. While newer routers
  use more flexible network processors for data plane processing, due
  to power and area constraints lookups in forwarding tables are done
  with custom lookup modules. Thus most of the proposed protocols can
  only be deployed with equipment upgrades.
  
  To speed up the deployment of new protocols, we propose a flexible
  lookup module, PLUG (Pipelined Lookup Grid). We can achieve generality
  without loosing efficiency because various custom lookup modules
  have the same fundamental features we retain: area dominated by memories,
  simple processing, and strict access patterns defined by the data
  structure. We implemented IPv4, Ethernet, Ethane, and SEATTLE in
  our dataflow-based programming model for the PLUG and mapped them
  to the PLUG hardware which consists of a grid of tiles. Throughput,
  area, power, and latency of PLUGs are close to those of specialized
  lookup modules.},

  SafetyNect maintains multiple, globally consistent checkpoints of

  Performance overhead is minimized by pipelining checkpoint validation
  with subsequent parallel execution. Using full-system simulation
  of a 16-way multiprocessor system, the paper shows that SafetyNet
  adds statistically insignificant runtime overhead in the common-case
  (adds no latency to 99.99\% of all instructions) and avoids a crash

  abstract = {We propose a scheme for transient-fault recovery called Simultaneously,
  and Redundantly Threaded processors with Recovery {(SRTR)} that enhances
  a previously proposed scheme for transient-fault detection, called
  Simultaneously and Redundantly Threaded {(SRT)} processors. {SRT}
  replicates an application into two communicating threads, one executing
  ahead of the other. The trailing thread repeats the computation performed
  by the leading thread, and the values produced by the two threads
  are compared. In {SRT} a leading instruction may commit before the
  check for faults occurs, relying on the trailing thread to trigger
  detection. In contrast, {SRTR} must not allow any leading instruction
  to commit before checking occurs, since a faulty instruction cannot
  be undone once the instruction commits. To avoid stalling leading
  instructions at commit while waiting for their trailing counterparts,
  {SRTR} exploits the time between the completion and commit of leading
  instructions. {SRTR} compares the leading and trailing values as
  soon as the trailing instruction completes, typically before the
  leading instruction reaches the commit point. To avoid increasing
  the bandwidth demand on the register file for checking register values,
  {SRTR} uses the register value queue {(RVQ)} to hold register values
  for checking. To reduce the bandwidth pressure on the {RVQ} itself
  {SRTR} employs dependence-based checking elision {(DBCE).} By reasoning
  that faults propagate through dependent instructions, {DBCE} exploits
  register (true) dependence chains so that only the last instruction
  in a chain uses the {RVQ,} and has the leading and trailing values
  checked. {SRTR} performs within 1\% and 7\% of {SRT} for {SPEC95}
  integer and floating-point programs, respectively. While {SRTR} without
  {DBCE} incurs about 18\% performance loss when the number of {RVQ}
  ports is reduced from four (which is performance-equivalent to an
  unlimited number) to two ports, with {DBCE,} a two-ported {RVQ} performs
  within 2\% of a four-ported {RVQ}},

  is to place each in its own address space. However, for tightly-coupled
  modules, this solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead.
  In this paper, we present a software approach to implementing fault
  isolation within a single address {space.Our} approach has two parts.
  First, we load the code and data for a distrusted module into its
  own fault do main, a logically separate portion of the application's
  address space. Second, we modify the object code of a distrusted
  module to prevent it from writing or jumping to an address outside
  its fault domain. Both these software operations are portable and
  programming language {independent.Our} approach poses a tradeoff
  relative to hardware fault isolation: substantially faster communication
  between fault domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution
  time for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for frequently communicating
  modules, implementing fault isolation in software rather than hardware
  can substantially improve end-to-end application performance.},

  at run-time to deliver performance improvements over static optimization.
  Dynamic optimization systems usually perform their optimization in
  series with the application's execution. This incurs overhead which
  reduces the benefit of dynamic optimization, and prevents some aggressive
  optimizations from being performed. In this paper we propose a new
  dynamic optimization framework called Trident. Concurrent with the
  program's execution, the framework uses hardware support to identify
  optimization opportunities, and uses spare threads on a multithreaded
  processor to perform dynamic optimizations for these optimization
  events. We evaluate the benefit of using Trident to guide code layout,
  basic compiler optimizations, and value specialization. Our results
  show that using Trident with these optimizations achieves an average
  20\% speedup, and is complementary with other memory latency tolerant
  techniques, such as prefetching.},

  Deep packet inspection is becoming prevalent for modern network processing
  systems. They inspect packet payloads for a variety of reasons, including
  intrusion detection, traffic policing, and load balancing. The focus
  of this paper is deep packet inspection in intrusion detection/prevention
  systems (IPSes). The performance critical operation in these systems
  is signature matching: matching payloads against signatures of vulnerabilities.
  Increasing network speeds of today's networks and the transition
  from simple string-based signatures to complex regular expressions
  has rapidly increased the performance requirement of signature matching.To
  meet these requirements, solutions range from hardware-centric ASIC/FPGA
  implementations to software implementations using high-performance
  microprocessors. In this paper, we propose a programmable SIMD architecture
  design for IPSes and develop a prototype implementation on an Nvidia
  G80 GPU. We first present a detailed architectural and microarchitectural
  analysis of signature matching. Our analysis shows that signature
  matching is well suited for SIMD processing because of regular control
  flow and parallelism available at the packet level. We examine the
  conventional approach of using deterministic finite automata (DFAs)
  and a new approach called extended finite automata (XFAs) which require
  far less memory than DFAs, but require scratch memory and small amounts
  of computation in each state. We then describe a SIMD design to implement
  DFAs and XFAs. Using a SIMD architecture provides flexibility, programmability,
  and design productivity which ASICs lack, while being area and power
  efficient which superscalar processors lack. Finally, we develop
  a prototype implementation using the G80 GPU as an example SIMD implementation.
  This system out-performs a Pentium4 by up to 9X and shows SIMD systems
  are a promising candidate for signature matching.},

  asynchronous pipeline circuits. The first circuit is a two-phase
  micropipeline but uses pseudo-static Svensson- style double edge-triggered
  D-flip-flops (DETDFF) for data storage in place of traditional transmission
  gate latches or Sutherland's capture-pass latches. The second circuit
  is a four-phase micropipeline with burst-mode control circuits. We
  compare our DETDFF and four-phase implementations of a FIFO buffer
  with the current state-of-the-art micropipeline implementation using
  four-phase controllers designed by Day and Woods for the AMULET-2
  processor. We implemented Day and Woods's design and both of our
  designs in the MOSIS 1.2 \&#956;m CMOS process and simulated them
  with a 4.6 V power supply and at 100¡C. Our SPICE simulations show
  that our DETDFF and four- phase designs have 70\% and 30\% higher
  throughput respectively than Day and Woods's design. This higher
  throughput for the DETDFF design is due to latching the data on both
  edges of the latch control, removing the need of a reset phase and
  simplifying the control structures. Our four-phase design, on the
  other hand, has higher throughput because of the simplified control
  structures and the removal of the latch enable buffers from the critical
  path. The four-phase design, though not quite as fast as the DETDFF
  design, requires much smaller area for data storage},

    Abstract = {The last decade has seen the integration of audio, video, and 3D graphics into traditional workloads as well as the emergence of new workloads dominated by the processing of data representing such information. Initially, these emerging workloads were supported by dedicated, application specific integrated circuits and digital signal processors. In order to avoid the added cost and complexity of these dedicated hardware solutions, microprocessor vendors have extended their architectures with instructions targeting multimedia applications. Despite general agreement on the direction of evolving workloads, there is little agreement on the nature of the architectural changes that should be made to support them. The focus of this work is to survey existing multimedia instruction sets and examine how their functionality maps to a set of computationally important kernels extracted from the previously developed Berkeley multimedia workload.}

      Technical Report 9512 and Western Research Laboratory Research Report 95/7.

      Parallel systems that support the shared memory abstraction are becoming
      widely accepted in many areas of computing.  Writing correct and efficient
      programs for such systems requires a formal specification of memory
      semantics, called a { \em memory consistency model} .  The most intuitive
      model---{ \em sequential consistency} ---greatly restricts the use of many
      performance optimizations commonly used by uniprocessor hardware and
      compiler designers, thereby reducing the benefit of using a multiprocessor.
      To alleviate this problem, many current multiprocessors support more { \em
        relaxed consistency models} .  Unfortunately, the models supported by
      various systems differ from each other in subtle yet important
      ways. Furthermore, precisely defining the semantics of each model often
      leads to complex specifications that are difficult to understand for
      typical users and builders of computer systems.

      The purpose of this tutorial paper is to describe issues related to
      memory consistency models in a way that would be understandable to
      most computer professionals.  We focus on consistency models proposed
      for hardware-based shared-memory systems. Many of these models are
        originally specified with an emphasis on the system optimizations they
          allow. We retain the system-centric emphasis, but use uniform and
          simple terminology to describe the different models. We also briefly
          discuss an alternate programmer-centric view that describes the models
          in terms of program behavior rather than specific system
          optimizations.

    Abstract:
      A memory model for a shared memory, multiprocessor commonly and often
      implicitly assumed by programmers is that of \fIsequential
      consistency\fR. This model guarantees that all memory accesses will
      appear to execute atomically and in program order.  An alternative
      model, \fIweak ordering\fR, offers greater performance potential.  Weak
      ordering was first defined by Dubois, Scheurich and Briggs in terms of
      a set of rules for hardware that have to be made visible to software.

      The central hypothesis of this work is that programmers prefer to
      reason about sequentially consistent memory, rather than having to
      think about weaker memory, or even write buffers.  Following this
      hypothesis, we re-define weak ordering as a contract between software
      and hardware.  By this contract, software agrees to some formally
      specified constraints, and hardware agrees to appear sequentially
      consistent to at least the software that obeys those constraints.  We
      illustrate the power of the new definition with a set of software
      constraints that forbid data races and an implementation for
      cache-coherent systems that is not allowed by the old definition.
