\section{Integration to Target Systems}
\label{imp-targets}


In our work, the target systems are ZooKeeper, Hadoop 2.0/Yarn, and
Cassandra.  ZooKeeper~\cite{Hunt+10-ZooKeeperPaper} is a distributed
synchronization service acting as a backbone of many distributed systems
such as HBase and High-Availability HDFS.  Hadoop
2.0/Yarn~\cite{Kumar+13-Yarn} is the current generation of Hadoop that
separates cluster management and processing components.
Cassandra~\cite{Lakshman+09-Cassandra} is a distributed key-value store
derived from Amazon Dynamo~\cite{DeCandia+07-Dynamo}.

In total, we have model checked \numProtocols\ protocols: ZooKeeper
leader election (ZLE) and atomic broadcast (ZAB), Hadoop cluster
management (CM) and speculative execution (SE), and Cassandra
read/write (RW), hinted handoff (HH) and gossiper (GS).  These
protocols are highly asynchronous and thus susceptible to message
re-orderings and failures.

Table~\ref{tab-policies} shows a real sample of protocol-specific
rules that we wrote.  Rules are in general very short; we only wrote
\numLinesRule\ lines/protocol on average.  This shows the simplicity
of SAMC's integration to a wide variety of distributed system protocols.
