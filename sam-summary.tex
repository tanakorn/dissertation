\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have introduced semantic-aware model checking or SAMC (pronounced
``Sam-C''). We have explained a basic concept and architecture, and explained
semantic-aware reduction policies in detail, including how to construct them by
extracting semantic knowledge from the code.
