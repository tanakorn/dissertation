\mycaption{fig-sck}{The complete flow of automation in \sck}{The
left-most figure illustrates testing in real-deployment, where testing
time is fast ($T$) but requires $N$ machines.
%
Stages (a) to (d) reflect the automated \sck process as described
in Section \ref{sc-summ}.
%
\stestm in stage (c) runs on one machine but will take some time
($>$$T$).
%
\stestp in stage (d) still runs on one machine but only consumes
a similar time as in deployment testing ($T$$+$$e$) and can be replayed
numerous times. }
