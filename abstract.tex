Cloud services must be accessible anytime and anywhere and not lose or corrupt
users' data (reliability), and scale as user base continues to grow
(scalability). Unfortunately, cloud-scale distributed systems behind the
services remain difficult to get right. Large-scale distributed systems are
getting more complex and new intricate bugs continue to create dependability
issues that cause major economic loss. Guaranteeing dependability has proven to
be challenging in these systems. In this proposal, We are tackling this
challenge. We try to unearth dependability bugs in cloud-scale distributed
systems, in the aspects of reliability and scalability

The first part of this proposal focuses on reliability aspect. We find that one
unsolved reliability problem in cloud systems is distributed concurrency bugs
(DC bugs). DC bugs are caused by non-deterministic order of distributed events
such as message arrivals, faults, and reboots. Cloud systems execute multiple
complicated distributed protocols concurrently. The possible interleavings of
the distributed events are beyond developer's imaginations and some
interleavings might not be handled properly. The buggy interleavings can cause
catastrophic failures such as data loss, data inconsistencies and downtimes.
Thus, we adopt model checking to unearth DC bugs.

The last seven years have seen a rise of implementation-level distributed system
model checkers (dmck) for verifying the reliability of real distributed systems.
Existing dmcks however rarely exercise multiple failures due to the state-space
explosion problem, and thus do not address present reliability challenges of
cloud systems in dealing with complex failures. To scale dmck, we introduce
semantic-aware model checking (SAMC), a white-box principle that takes simple
semantic information of the target system and incorporates that knowledge into
state-space reduction policies. We introduce four novel reduction policies,
which collectively alleviate redundant re-orderings of messages, crashes, and
reboots. SAMC can find DC bugs one to two orders of magnitude faster compared to
state-of-the-art techniques. 

In the second part, we focus on scalability aspect. Scale surpasses the limit of
a single machine in meeting users' increasing demands of compute and storage,
which led to many inventions of cloud-scale distributed systems.  On the
negative side, scale creates new development and deployment issues.  Developers
must ensure that their algorithms and protocol designs to be scal- able.
However, until real deployment takes place, unexpected bugs in the actual
implementations are unforeseen. We believe this new era of cloud-scale
distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs.
They are latent bugs that are scale-dependent; they only surface in large-scale
deployments, but not in small/medium-scale ones. Their presence jeopardizes
systems reliability and availability at scale.

We present \sck, a methodology that enables developers to scale-check
distributed systems and find scalability bugs on one machine. To colocate a
large number of nodes without sacrificing accuracy, we remove hardware
contentions with four novel strategies. And with these techniques, we achieve
high collocation factor.
