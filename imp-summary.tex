\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we have talked about our prototype \sampro \; we have showed
technical detail how we built it and what cloud systems we targeted. In
addition, to give a sense of how protocol-specific reduction rules look like,
we have given an example of the rules for ZLE protocol.
