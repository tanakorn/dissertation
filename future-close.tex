\section{Closing Words}

Cloud-scale distributed systems are the leading actors in the age of cloud
computing. The dependability of cloud services mainly rely on these distributed
systems. This dissertation addresses an essential question of cloud
dependability: ``{\em how can we make cloud-scale distributed systems more
dependable?}'' Our work focuses on two unsolved problems, distributed
concurrency bugs and scalability bugs. These two types of bugs are novel and
unique to cloud-scale environment, and we found not many works addressing them.
We address these two types of bugs by conducting formal studies to understand
the natureof the bugs and advancing state of the art of system checking. We hope
this dissertation bring new insights on combating distributed concurrency bugs
and appeal more attentions for scalability bugs. However, there are still many
new classes of cloud-unique bugs waiting for system community to address in the
future.
