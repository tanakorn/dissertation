Cloud bug study & This is a previous work from our group. It was an equal effort
work. We built \cdb\ and published the \cbs\ paper at SoCC '14
\cite{Gunawi+14-Cbs}. Tanakorn Leesatapornwongsa was responsible for ZooKeeper
bug study in this work. \\

DC bug taxonomy & This is our complete work. It is done in 2015. We released our
study and taxonomy (named \taxdc) online. This work was published at ASPLOS '16
\cite{Leesatapornwongsa+16-TaxDC}. Two students in this work did equal effort.
Tanakorn Leesatapornwongsa was responsible for Cassandra and ZooKeeper DC bug
study. \\

Scalability bug study & This is our preliminary work to understand scalability
bugs in distributed systems. This is a foundation in our scale check project \\

Semantic-aware model checking & This is our complete work. It is done in 2014.
We released our model checker to the public and published the SAMC paper at OSDI
'14\\

Scale check emulation and metho\-do\-logy & This is our ongoing work. We are
introducing scale check concepts to Cassandra, Riak, and Voldemort systems. \\

\section{Research Plan}

To fulfill the dissertation research, we are working on our last piece, {\em
scale check}. This is a plan of action we proposed.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Develop processing illusion (PIL) on Cassandra, 1 month, 12/1/2016 - 12/31/2016

\item Develop single-process cluster (SPC) on Cassandra, 3 weeks, 1/1/2017 - 1/21/2017

\item Develop global event driven architecture (GEDA) on Cassandra, 1 weeks, 1/22/2017 - 1/28/2017

\item Develop memory footprint reduction (MFR) on Cassandra, 1 week, 1/29/2017 - 2/4/2017

\item Integrate all techniques and summarize the \sck\ methodology, 1 week, 2/5/2017 - 2/11/2017

\item Apply \sck\ to Riak and Voldemort, 3 weeks, 2/12/2017 - 2/25/2017

\item Evaluate \sck\, 2 weeks, 2/26/2017 - 3/11/2017

\item Write the dissertation, 1 month, 3/12/2017 - 4/12/2017

\item Defend the dissertation

\end{enumerate}
