\chapter{Research Plan}
\label{chp-plan}

To unearth bugs in cloud-scale distributed systems, the first thing we need is
comprehensive knowledge about them, so we can establish proper solutions. In our
research plan, we start with general bug study on cloud systems to see the big
picture of the current problems. Then we dissect DC bugs and scalability bugs to
analyze.
%
For DC bugs, we will advance the state of the art of dmcks. We are introducing 
more pruning policies to tackle state-space explosion problem. And for
scalability bugs, we will fill the missing piece of control-plane protocol bugs
focusing on P2P systems.
