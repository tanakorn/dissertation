\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclude}

Complex failures is a norm in cloud systems and deep bugs still linger in the
cloud.  To address present reliability challenges, dmcks must incorporate
complex failures, but due to the problem of state space explosion, existing
dmcks do not scale in this regard.  We strongly believe that without semantic
knowledge dmck hits a scalability wall.

In this thesis, we propose semantic-aware model checking (SAMC), a white-box
model checking approach that takes semantic knowledge and incorporates it in
reduction policies. 

We show a strong case that the SAMC principle can elegantly address this
scalability problem.  SAMC is simple and powerful; with simple semantic
knowledge, we show that dmcks can scale significantly.  We presented four
specific reduction policies, but beyond this, we believe our work triggers the
discussion of two important research questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em What} other semantic knowledge can scale dmck?
\item {\em How} to extract white-box information from the target system? 
\end{enumerate}
We hope (and believe) that the SAMC principle can trigger future research in this
space.
