In this proposal, we aim to unearth hidden bugs in cloud-scale distributed
systems that weaken reliability and scalability of the systems. For reliability
bugs, we focus in distributed concurrency (DC) bugs. For scalability bugs, we
focus in control-plane protocol bug, specifically in P2P storage systems.

%We started our work by performing bug studies. Based on our initial work for
%cloud bug study, we dissect DC bugs and study their critical characteristics.
%Then we look at scalability bugs that are related 

The key idea for unearthing DC bugs is advancing model checking techniques for
dmcks to tackle state-space explosion. Because existing dmcks treat every target
system as a complete \textit{black box}, and therefore perform unnecessary
reorderings of distributed events that would lead to the same explored states
(\ie, redundant executions).  To tackle the problem, we introduced
Semantic-Aware Model Checking (SAMC), a novel white-box model checking approach
that takes \textit{semantic knowledge} of how distributed events (specifically,
messages, crashes, and reboots) are processed by the target system and
incorporates that information in reduction policies. The policies are based on
sound reduction techniques such as DPOR and symmetry.

And for scalability bugs, we believe from the study that we need to scale check
distributed system implementation at real scale, not via simulation nor
extraploation. Our proposed solution is to colocate as many nodes as possible
(\eg, hundreds) on one machine without sacrificing accuracy by {\em emulate}
hardware resources such that the individual nodes behave as if they run on
independent machines. We propose four emulation concepts to mitigate hardware
contention problems. We are exploring these concepts to build scale check
methodology for checking control-plane protocols in P2P key-value stores.
