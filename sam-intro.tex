\section{Overview}
Semantic-aware model checking (SAMC) is a white-box model checking
approach that takes semantic knowledge of how events (\eg, messages,
crashes, and reboots) are processed by the target system and
incorporates that information in reduction policies.  To show the
intuition behind SAMC, we first give an example of  a simple leader
election protocol. Then, we present SAMC architecture and our four
reduction policies.
