As more data and computation move from local to cloud settings, cloud-scale
distributed systems such as scale-out storage systems \cite{Chang+06-BigTable,
DeCandia+07-Dynamo, Ghemawat+03-GoogleFS, Nightingale+12-FlatFDS}, computing
frameworks \cite{DeanGhemawat04-MapReduce, Murray+13-NaiadTimelyDataflow},
synchronization services \cite{Burrows06-Chubby, Hunt+10-ZooKeeperPaper}, and
cluster management services \cite{Hindman+11-Mesos, Kumar+13-Yarn} have become
a dominant backbone for many cloud services. Client-side software is getting
thinner and more heavily relies on the capability, reliability, and
availability of cloud systems. 

Cloud outage could cause

Unfortunately, such cloud-scale distributed systems remain difficult to get
right. 


Guaranteeing dependability has proven to be challenging in these systems
\cite{Gunawi+11-FateDestini, Guo+11-Demeter, Yang+09-Modist, Wang+14-Exalt}.

% scale, scale ... 
Is scale a friend or a foe \cite{Ousterhout+11-ScaleFriendEnemy}?
On the positive side, scale surpasses the limit of a single machine in
meeting users' increasing demands of compute and storage, which led to
many inventions of ``cloud-scale'' distributed systems
\cite{Chang+06-BigTable, 
DeanGhemawat04-MapReduce, 
DeCandia+07-Dynamo,
Ghemawat+03-GoogleFS, 
Hindman+11-Mesos,
Verma+15-Borg}.  The field has witnessed a
phenomenal deployment scale of such systems;
Netflix runs tens of 500-node Cassandra clusters \cite{RunningNetflix13},
Apple deploys a total of 100,000 Cassandra nodes \cite{WikiCassandra}, 
and Yahoo! recently revealed the use of 40,000 Hadoop servers,
with a 4500-node cluster as the largest one \cite{LargestHadoop}.

% dark side, foe
On the negative side, scale creates new development and deployment issues.
Developers must ensure that their algorithms and protocol designs
to be scalable.
However, until real deployment takes place, unexpected bugs 
in the actual implementations are unforeseen.
% more and more
We believe this new era of cloud-scale distributed systems has given birth
to a new type of bug: {\em scalability bugs}.  They are latent bugs that
are scale-dependent; they only surface in large-scale deployments, but not 
in small/medium-scale ones.  Their presence jeopardizes systems
reliability and availability at scale.
