The first person I need to thank is my advisor and also one of the
thesis-committe members, Prof. Haryadi Gunawi. Without him, this thesis could
not happen. He guided me since the beginning to the end.  I have learned a lot
from him, not only research skills but also other soft skills to that surely will
benefit me during my future Ph.D. life. 

I also need to thank the other two committee members, Professor Shan Lu and
Professor Ravi Chugh that kindly to be my committee. Although I asked them in
very short manner, they still tried to schedule their valuable time to reivew
this thesis and give some feedback. I really appreciate their time.

And I need to thank my collegues, Mingzhe Hao, Pallavi Joshi (NEC Lab), and
Jeffrey Lukman (Surya University) for their hard working; and thank to my
friends, department faculty and staff to help me many things when I was working
on the thesis.

Lastly, there are five women I want to give big thanks to. The first most
important one is my mother, the woman who always supports me throughout my life.
The second one is Louise, my sweet fianc\'e; she always helps and supports me
during my hard time working on this thesis. And the other three are my lovely
sisters, Fon, Nuch, and Nid; they always make me feel good everytime I talk with
them.
