\section{Summary}
In this chapter we have evaluated SAMC by anwering these three questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How fast is SAMC in finding deep bugs compared to other state-of-the-art techniques?  
\item Can SAMC find new deep bugs?  
\item How much reduction ratio does SAMC provide?
\end{enumerate}
Table~\ref{tab-oldbugs} answers the first question by showing that SAMC is one
to two orders of magnitude faster. And to answer the second question, we can
also show that SAMC can find new bugs in cloud systems by integrating it to the
newest vesion code. For the third question, we have answered it by
table~\ref{tab-reduce} showing reduction ratio of 37x - 166x compare to bDP.
