\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{DC Bugs are unsolved problem}

Cloud-scale distributed systems are foundation of cloud services.

%Cloud services are built on top of systems that I call cloud-scale distributed
%systems.

Cloud-scale distributed systems need more dependability.

My research focuses on improving dependability of the systems, specifically, by
unearthing distributed concurrency and scalability bugs.

I adopt various techniques from various fields to combat the bugs. Such as model
checking, emulation, and static analysis.

\subsection{Reserach contribution}

And here is my research contribution.

%Cloud-scale distributed systems need more dependability.
%
%They need to be more reliable, no downtime, no data loss or corrupted.
%
%In cloud era, they also need to be scalable as users' demands increase.
%
%My work focuses on distributed concurrency and scalability bugs.
%
%My vision here is to raise awareness on combating them.
